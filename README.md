Module 1 Challenge
Hi, my name is Jason Grant and this is my Module 1 Challenge.

The HTML needed alt image attributes for all images. I provided a description in case the images were unable to load or a screen reader is being used. alt="whatever the picture is supposed to show"

Clicking on the Search Engine Optimization link did nothing, it should have moved the screen to the element containing Search engine optimization. I added id="search-engine-optimization" and now the link works the same as the other 2 links.

The title element stated simply, "Website." I changed the title element to; "Horiseon Social Solution Services, Inc."

All source code came from git@github.com:coding-boot-camp/urban-octo-telegram.git, this is not my original work.

The code can be found here as well in my Github repo, git@github.com:jason82autotech/Module-1-Challenge.git
